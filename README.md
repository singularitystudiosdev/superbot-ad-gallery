# superbot — ad gallery

Every frontend ad creative for **superbot**, in one shareable page. Click any tile to
zoom the full-size image or watch the animation play live. Static — no build, no deps.

**Live:** https://singularitystudiosdev.github.io/superbot-ad-gallery/

## Contents

- **Animations (8)** — the .gg landing (ASCII + textmode), the setup-wizard demo, the
  IDE-merge / orbit hero spots and their variants. Each one is the real page, embedded
  and playing.
- **App screenshots (5)** — dashboard, activity, credits, settings, setup.
- **SUPERBOT.GG shots (5)** — preview + mono textmode passes.
- **IDE icons (8)** — the IDE set used by the merge spots.

## Structure

```
index.html          gallery page (grid + lightbox)
gallery.js          data fetch + grid + lightbox (vanilla, no deps)
styles.css          dark textmode theme
manifest.json       generated item list
gen-manifest.mjs    regenerates manifest.json (node gen-manifest.mjs)
animations/         each animation page, self-contained, served as-is
assets/img/         static images
assets/shots/       animation thumbnails (playwright captures)
```

New animation thumbnails: capture with playwright headless at 1280x720
(`npx playwright screenshot --viewport-size "1280,720" --wait-for-timeout 4500 <url> <out>`), pick the better-looking frame.

## Regenerating

Add a file under `assets/img/` (or a folder under `animations/`), then:

```
node gen-manifest.mjs
```

Thumbnails for new animations are playwright captures at 1280x720; reuse
`capture-230cb400.mjs` and pick the better-looking frame.
